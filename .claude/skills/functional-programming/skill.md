description:
  Write functional code following best practices for reusability, extensibility, and maintainability. Use when
  developing code that should minimize bugs through immutability, pure functions, and composition Applies across all
  programming languages.

- Functional Programming Best Practices

  - Pure Functions
  - Immutability First
  - Composition Over Inheritance
  - Higher-Order Functions
  - Declarative Over Imperative
  - Type Safety
  - Self-Documenting Code
  - Minimize Shared State
  - Use explicit error types (Result, Either, Option) instead of exceptions for expected errors
  - Expressions should be replaceable with their values without changing program behavior
  - Use DRY: eliminate code duplication
  - Write modular and composable code

- Refactoring Principles
  - Extract functions when logic repeats or becomes complex.
  - Extract constants for magic numbers and strings.
  - Parameterize differences when functions are similar, extract common logic and parameterize variations.
  - Name intermediate steps by breaking complex expressions into named values that explain each transformation.
  - Identify entities for encapsulation.
